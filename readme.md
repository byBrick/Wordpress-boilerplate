=== byBrick WordPress boilerplate ===

== Description ==

A WordPress HTML5 boilerplate for new WordPress projects. Suitable for most projects. 
NOTE: This is a small boilerplate intended for small and quick sites. For bigger more "complete" WordPress themes I recomment you check out _s (https://github.com/Automattic/_s) by Automatic instead.

== Features ==

* Loads jQuery from Google CDN
* Loads html5shiv from Google CDN (for Internet Explorer only)
* Custom login image
* Menu support
* CSS Reset & Clearfix
* Default typography
* Default WordPress CSS classes

== Changelog ==

= 1.3 =
* No longer auto-loads jquery from CDN. Use a plugin like 'Use Google Libraries' (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/use-google-libraries/) if you wish to do so.
* Title tag optimized for 'WordPress SEO by Yoast' (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/).
* Doesn't auto add Google Analytics code anymore. There are better ways to implement GA that dropping the script tag on every page in the footer.php. Use 'Google Analytics for WordPress' (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/) plugin for better GA support.
* Translatable.

= 1.2 =
* Updated jQuery to version 1.7.1.
* html5shiv now only loads for Internet Explorer version 8 and down.
* Added support for pinning sites in IE9/Windows.
* Added XFN 1.1 relationships meta data link.
* Updated how <title></title> works.
* Cleanup of code.

= 1.1 =
* Removed columns for functions.php and style.css. Use byBrick Columns Plugin instead.  

= 1.0 =
* Launch baby, launch!
